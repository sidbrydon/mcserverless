# Multicloud Serverless Approach

This is referenced from the following article on LinkedIn, link below, the code is designed to provide the user 
with a way of understanding how to deploy a serverless function from Cloud A and then redeploy it to Cloud B.
It does not talk about the strategy of using multicloud, this is an ongoing conversation, not relevant here. 

This is purely meant as a technical feasability study to understand where the complexity sits.
